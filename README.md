PMValidation is a modular, extendable text validation library for iOS. It comes with several common validation types for often-used tasks like validating registration forms, however it was architected to be easily extended with your own validation types. PMValidation was originally built by Poet & Mountain for use in the iOS app [Imprints](https://itunes.apple.com/app/imprints/id577195548?mt=8), but has now been open-sourced.

## Overview

At its simplest, PMValidation starts with an instance of PMValidationUnit. Each PMValidationUnit controls one or more PMValidationType objects, and PMValidationUnit provides an overall validation state for the types registered with it. All validation types are subclasses of PMValidationType, and you can do the same to easily create your own validator types. 

Generally, a PMValidationUnit handles the validation of one text object. When you are validating more than one text object, such as with a validation form, the PMValidationManager class is useful. This class controls one or more PMValidationUnit objects, providing an overall validation status and notification routing.

## Getting Started

The included [validation form example]() project should give you a good overview of how PMValidation works.


### The basics

Here's a basic example, creating a string length constraint which passes validation while the string is between 4 and 8 characters.

``` objective-c
PMValidationLengthType *length_type = [PMValidationLengthType validator];
length_type.minimumCharacters = 4;
length_type.maximumCharacters = 8;

PMValidationUnit *unit = [PMValidationUnit validationUnit];
[unit registerValidationType:length_type];

// listen for validation updates from unit
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:PMValidationUnitUpdateNotification object:unit queue:nil usingBlock:
		^(NSNotification *notification) {
        PMValidationUnit *unit = (PMValidationUnit *)notification.object;
        
				BOOL is_valid = unit.isValid;
				if (!is_valid) {
					NSDictionary *errors = [notification.userInfo valueForKey:@"errors"];
				}   
    }
];
 
[unit validateText:@"Velvet Underground"];
```

That example only uses one validation type class, but you can add as many as you want to create very complex validation tests. Of course, power users may want to take advantage of the PMValidationRegexType class, which allows use of a regular expression as a validation test. For complex use cases this can be preferable -- PMValidationEmailType uses a regular expression internally -- but using more basic type classes together can provide greater readability. YMMV.

Validating static strings is cool, but let's hook up a PMValidationUnit to a UITextField so we can dynamically validate it as its text changes. While we could do this with just a PMValidationUnit, it's a bit easier to use PMValidationManager for this.

```objective-c
PMValidationManager *manager = [PMValidationManager validationManager];
PMValidationEmailType *email_type = [PMValidationEmailType validator];
PMValidationUnit *email_unit = [manager registerTextField:self.emailTextField
                                       forValidationTypes:[NSSet setWithObjects:email_type, nil]
                                               identifier:@"email"];
																							 
// listen for validation updates from the manager
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:PMValidationStatusNotification object:manager queue:nil usingBlock:
	^(NSNotification *notification) {
    	BOOL is_valid = [(NSNumber *)[notification.userInfo objectForKey:@"status"] boolValue];
			if (!is_valid) {
				NSDictionary *units = [notification.userInfo objectForKey:@"units"];
				NSDictionary *email_dict = [units objectForKey:email_type.identifier];
				NSDictionary *email_errors = [email_dict objectForKey:@"errors"];
			} 
   }
];
```
